# Alumni-Connection-Management-System
# SQL and PL/SQL
The aim of this **Alumni Connection and Management System** project is to build a
system that will be able to manage alumni data of a college and provide easy
access to the same. Alumni of a college generally stay in touch with their
immediate friends but find it hard to stay connected with other college mates.
Contact between alumni can be used to forge business connections and to gain
references or insight in a new field. New college students will be initially given a
student login ID. Access to the system can help them in building connections to
help them in their projects or for placements.
